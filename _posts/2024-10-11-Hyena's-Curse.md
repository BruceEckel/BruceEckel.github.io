In the before times, people lived in harmony with the world. They ate what they could find and sometimes this meant animals. Bigger animals would eat smaller animals, and sometimes that meant people. People also died from other things. It was not a paradise where nothing changed and nobody suffered or died, but people accepted it and lived within it and that was harmony.

The one thing that set people apart from the other animals is that they could anticipate the future. In particular, they could see when they had enough and when they didn't have enough. When they didn't have enough, sometimes they could do something about it. Without this ability, people probably would have died out, as they had no fur or claws or other advantages, other than their ability to hold onto things.

In those days, Hyena was the smartest animal. It observed and thought about the implications of things. Hyena found itself thinking about people more and more. In particular, it watched how people cooperated with each other to defend themselves from predators and to kill animals much bigger than themselves for meat.

This cooperation was no new thing. Hyenas cooperated with each other when they harassed Lion. But they only cooperated in established ways. Hyena watched humans change their ways of cooperation, sometimes more than once in a single year. And over the millennia these changes in cooperation seemed to be speeding up.

Hyena found this deeply unsettling. It could see that people were going to start dominating the world. Although it could think deep and long about the world it was not equipped to do anything about it. It could only eat and mate and see the future.

After watching and worrying as people continued to evolve their ability to cooperate, Hyena finally came up with an idea. It would plant a trick in the minds of people. This idea would cause people to battle among themselves and slow down or perhaps stop the domination of people over the world.
